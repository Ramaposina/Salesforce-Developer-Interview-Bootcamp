# 🚀 Salesforce Developer Interview Bootcamp – Day 2



## 📅 Day
**Day 2 – Apex, Governor Limits, Asynchronous Apex & LWC Communication**

---

# 📖 Overview

Day 2 focused on learning Salesforce Apex best practices, understanding Governor Limits and Bulkification, implementing Asynchronous Apex (Future, Queueable, and Batch Apex), and building Lightning Web Components (LWC) with Parent-to-Child and Child-to-Parent communication.

---

# ✅ Tasks Completed

## 🔹 Task 1 – Apex Trigger & Trigger Handler

### Objective
Implement the Trigger Handler Pattern.

### Completed
- Created an Apex Trigger on `Vehicle__c`.
- Implemented a Trigger Handler class.
- Tested trigger execution.
- Verified execution using Debug Logs.

---

## 🔹 Task 2 – Governor Limits & Bulkification

### Bad Trigger
- Wrote a trigger with SOQL inside a `for` loop.
- Inserted 200+ records.
- Observed the Governor Limit exception:
  - **System.LimitException: Too many SOQL queries: 101**

### Bulkified Trigger
- Moved SOQL outside the loop.
- Used collections for efficient processing.
- Successfully processed 200+ records without Governor Limit errors.

---

## 🔹 Task 3 – Asynchronous Apex

### Future Apex
- Created a Future Method using `@future`.
- Executed the method through Execute Anonymous.
- Verified execution using Apex Jobs.

### Queueable Apex
- Created a Queueable Apex class.
- Executed using `System.enqueueJob()`.
- Verified completion through Apex Jobs.

### Batch Apex
- Created `VehicleBatchHandler`.
- Implemented `start()`, `execute()`, and `finish()` methods.
- Executed Batch Apex successfully.
- Verified execution through Apex Jobs.

---

## 🔹 Task 4 – Lightning Web Components (LWC)

### Parent → Child Communication
- Created `vehicleParent` component.
- Created `vehicleChild` component.
- Passed Vehicle Record Id using `@api`.
- Displayed:
  - Customer Name
  - Vehicle Number

### Child → Parent Communication
- Implemented Custom Events.
- Parent successfully received the event.
- Updated the UI with:

```text
Button Clicked Successfully
```
